                            The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.
                            A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.
                            A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position.'
